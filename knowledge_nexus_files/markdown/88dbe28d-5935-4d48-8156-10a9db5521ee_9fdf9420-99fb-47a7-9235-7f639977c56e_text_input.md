Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of MarkItDown into KnowledgeNexus will handle file-based inputs as follows: any supported document (PDF, DOCX, HTML, TXT, etc.) is preprocessed into Markdown, the original and markdown are stored in a structured file library, and a lightweight database record links them with metadata and extracted insights. All content (including embedded images/tables) is captured in the Markdown text, eliminating the need for separate handling of those elements. This plan ensures that the solution is modular (the conversion is a distinct step that can be scaled or modified independently) and scalable (storing files on disk and processing asynchronously allows the system to handle large volumes and sizes of documents). Implementing this strategy will enable KnowledgeNexus to seamlessly ingest heterogeneous files and focus on extracting entities and knowledge from the unified Markdown content effectively.
