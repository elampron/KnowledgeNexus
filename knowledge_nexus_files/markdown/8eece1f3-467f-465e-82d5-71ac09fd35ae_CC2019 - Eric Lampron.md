# Presentation Best Practices
Pictures speak 1,000 words; include a screenshot or picture on each slide to add visual interest.
A good goal is to aim for 7 words per slide.
Increase attention and interaction by using a variety of communication mediums, such as polls and videos.
Plan and follow a rough agenda including a breakdown by minute to help stay on track.

# Chart Example

### Chart

| Category | Series 1 | Series 2 | Series 3 | Series 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|

# Lots of data? Minimalize and Plan
Gray is used to de-emphasize data that is less important. Use cool gray 3 or cool gray 7. See slide 7 for color formulas.
All elements have the same interior margins as text blocks.
When a chart or graphic, has more elements than can easily be aligned to the grid, align the outer edges of the group, top, bottom, left and right edges to the grid.
It is preferable to keep the group aligned to the left border.
