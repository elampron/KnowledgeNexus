Like many boys at this stage in life, Eric wanted to become an Astronaut, or a Marine Biologist later. He loved reading sci-fi, fleuve noir series. He LOVED star Wars. He was so curious about everything, including science, space, technology, animals. For 10 years, he lived in the rural part of the small village of Senneterre.
